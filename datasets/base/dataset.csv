lord lord to see what folly reigns in us,"[67, 67, 5, 85, 32, 993, 3861, 11]"
how now what means this passion at his name,"[70, 44, 32, 326, 24, 1057, 46, 25]"
why not on proteus as of all the rest,"[91, 12, 42, 2982, 22, 6, 37, 2]"

to plead for love deserves more fee than hate,"[5, 1298, 16, 59, 1749, 55, 2046, 79]"
and yet i would i had oerlooked the letter,"[4, 84, 3, 43, 3, 77, 14133, 2]"

there wanteth but a mean to fill your song,"[73, 7831, 19, 8, 264, 5, 868, 27]"
go get you gone and let the papers lie,"[76, 242, 7, 207, 4, 61, 2, 3407]"
she makes it strange but she would be best pleased,"[48, 285, 14, 431, 19, 48, 43, 18]"
nay would i were so angerd with the same,"[151, 43, 3, 74, 29, 14136, 21, 2]"
